Version: 0.2.0
Author: Greg Wilson <greg.wilson@rstudio.com>
Maintainer: Greg Wilson <greg.wilson@rstudio.com>
Description: Functions to check data integrity between stages of magrittr
  pipelines without modifying the data using using expression syntax similar to
  that used in dplyr's filtering and summarization.  Messages can be customized,
  individual tests can be switched on and off in place, and error reports can be
  directed to user-defined outputs.
