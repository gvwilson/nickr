Title: Checking Data Integrity in Pipelines
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Greg Wilson <greg.wilson@rstudio.com>
Maintainer: Greg Wilson <greg.wilson@rstudio.com>
Description: Functions that can be inserted between stages of a magrittr pipeline
  to check that data satisfies user-specified conditions without modifying that data.
  Users can specify conditions on rows, columns, or groups as expressions;
  define their own error messages; control the way that error reports are logged;
  and enable or disable filters selectively so that they can be left in place in
  production.
